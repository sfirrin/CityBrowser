    <h3>About</h3>
    <p>City Browser is a project of <a href="http://firrincieli.com">Stephen Firrincieli</a> and all the code can be seen
        on <a href="http://github.com/sfirrin/CityBrowser">my github page</a>. I wanted a project to practice using
        Javascript and I'm interested in places and data about them so I thought this would be fun to work on.</p>

    <h3>Data sources</h3>
    <p>
        The data used in City Browser was taken from a few sources provided by different US government agencies.
        I got the data into a <a href="https://github.com/sfirrin/CityBrowser/blob/gh-pages/resources/cities.json">manageable JSON</a>
        using web scraping in some cases and by processing data files in others. The code for generating the JSON was
        written in Python and can also be found at <a href="#">UPDATE THIS TO SHOW PYTHON PROJECT</a>.
    </p>

                NOAA provides climate data for each station it keeps track of in text files. First, the script determined the nearest
                station to the coordinates of the city on Wikipedia. NOAA provides pre-calculated data on the monthly normal (mean)
                highs and lows for each station over a 30-year period. To determine the mean maximum and minimum temperatures,
                the script read the daily weather for each station for as long as it has been available, and averaged each
                month's maximums and minimums over all the available years.

                The U.S. Census Bureau makes estimates of the current year's population for each city in between census years.
                The Census Bureau's website was difficult to scrape data from so I scraped the equivalent 2015 data from the
                Wikipedia page.

                An office of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, the Office of Policy Development and Research
                produces yearly estimates of the median rent for areas of the United States. The script would first
                search the spreadsheet for the name and state of the city. If it could not find the specific city, it would
                fall back to use the county the city is within.
